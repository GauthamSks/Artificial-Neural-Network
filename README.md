# <div align="center">MNIST: Handwritten Digit Classification<div>

 <div align="center"> Here we shall use a simple 3-layered <i>Multilayer Perceptron</i> to classify <b>MNIST</b> <i>Handwritten Dataset</i>. The dataset consists of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale training images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9 and 10,000 testing samples. A general architecture of the model to be used is shown below in the image. Here I have implemented stochastic gradient descent from scratch. I have also done a PyTorch implementation of the same model for easier understanding.</div>
